The way i brainstormed for part B was pretty simple i first tried to think of things in the law feild that was an issue and i thought of ways to solve these problems and thats what led to my ideas for inventions For example if your a lawyer and your defendent says that he was at a location with camreas then the people at the firm would half to comb throught the footage trying to look for the man but if there was an ai that would know what the defendent looked like it could scan the footage instead and try and find him and after the ai found the person a human would check it to make sure it was acurate.
